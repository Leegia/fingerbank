==========

No! Fingerbank is not an organ bank for nice fingers ;)

It is a database for device fingerprinting based on different properties (DHCP fingerprints, 
DHCP vendors, OUI, user-agents, ...) allowing your applications to fully detect then handle 
a custom workflow based on the device type.
